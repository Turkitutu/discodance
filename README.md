# discodance!
An **unfinished** multiplayer dance game, **discodance!** was conceived by [Massito](https://github.com/unlocker001), who envisioned a fun and interactive way to combine real-time multiplayer gameplay with a vibrant, animated dance floor. The game is built with Pixi.js (for the frontend) and Node.js (for the backend). It was developed as a creative project aimed at bringing together dynamic dance mechanics and social interaction.

### Current Status
This project has been **paused** for several years and remains **incomplete**. While the multiplayer functionality and game mechanics are partially developed, significant work is still needed. The project was put on hold due to a lack of available team members to create the necessary assets and the team's unavailability over time.

### Tech Stack
**Frontend:** Pixi.js for rendering 2D graphics and animations.
**Backend:** Node.js for handling server-side logic and multiplayer functionality.
**WebSockets:** Real-time communication using row WebSocket (ByteArray).
**Express:** Web server for hosting the game client.
